# Horiseon Website Accessibility Standards
Horiseon page with features that support disabilities. 

## Description
Web applications being accessible to most if not all people is a important consideration for web development and its businesses. This project solved the issue where the images did not have alternate text for people who are unable to view the images. By moving around the CSS code to align with the semantic structure of the HTML code, the efficiency and sustainability of the code. The original CSS code contained unnecessary code that was shortened upon for readability, along with comments to seperate each section.
